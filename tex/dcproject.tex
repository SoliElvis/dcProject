\clearpage
It could be argued that convex optimization is, to once again use
Boyd's terminology, a technology, and while it is a very useful and
beautiful tool many real life problems are indeed non convex which
prove to be very resistant to traditional techniques. In those cases
there are different approaches :
\begin{itemize}
	\item Convexification where we approximate the problem
		by a convex one and control the erro
	\item Brute force AI type optimization where we find
		heuristics informed by "real-life" knowledge
		of the problem to find solutions which are
		useful and seem quite correct but with no
		optimality guarantee whatsoever
	\item Carefully extend the tools from convex analysis to some
		well defined cases of where non-convexity arises.
\end{itemize}
In this paper I discuss the third case in the specific context of the difference 
of two convex functions. I assume knowledge of the basics of convex analysis such
as Fenchel duality, lower-semicontinuityo, sub-differentials, epigraphs and relative
interiors. I hope however that the treatment will illuminate and motivate some
of those motivations.  I will start by defining some notation which will be
used throughout the text.  \\The standard DC  Program is the following:
\begin{equation}
	P \qquad \lambda :=	\inf\{g(x) - h(x) \, | \, x\in \mathbb{R}^n\}
	\qquad
	g,h \in \Gamma_0
\end{equation}
At first read this program might seem quite arbitrary and simple. Of all the
ways to start exploring the non-convex realm why choose this one. It turns out
that there are three very good reasons to explore such a program. First and
foremost it is actually a very natural generalization and step outside of
convexity for reasons I will explore later. Moreover there are many real-life
problems which can be very easily modelled by such programs and finally a
powerful algorithm has been developped for DC programs (DCA algorithm) which
although it doesn't guarantee global optimality \emph{does} often converge to
global solutions and does so very robustly and efficiently. Those three factors
suggest the relevance of investigating those programs.
